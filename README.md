## Running master checkouts

Third-party components are handled as git submodules which have to be initialized first. So aside from the regular git checkout invoking `git submodule update --init` or a similar command is needed, for details see Git documentation.

Several apps by default included in regular releases like [firstrunwizard](https://github.com/nextcloud/firstrunwizard) or [gallery](https://github.com/nextcloud/gallery) are missing in `master` and have to be installed manually as required.

That aside Git checkouts can be handled the same as release archives.

Note they should never be used on production systems.

## Nextcloud VM
If you're not familiar with Linux, or simply just want to get up and running on a pre-configured system in no time - we have developed a VM that you can download. Just extract it and mount it in VMware or VirtualBox and you're all set.

Download the latest version of the [Nextcloud VM](https://github.com/nextcloud/vm/releases/)
